**Game Developer | Computer Science Student @ SIT – DigiPen (IMGD)**  

##Hi there! I am Ming Sheng.

I’m a **game developer** and **computer science student** who loves both **playing games and creating them**.  
I portray myself as both a **gamer** and a **developer**, bringing passion from the player’s perspective into my work.  

I have strong coding skills and experience collaborating with teams to bring ideas to life.  
I’ve worked with **Unity, Unreal Engine, and custom C++ engines**, building everything from gameplay systems to tools.  
Game design is also a big part of my journey — I have hands-on experience in **level design, systems design, and AI for games**.  

Currently studying **Computer Science (Interactive Media & Game Development)** at  
**Singapore Institute of Technology – DigiPen (Singapore)**.
